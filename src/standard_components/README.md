# "Standard Components"

This is going to be my standard library I'll use across projects. This, eventually, will be a cargo package.

* ./internal - internal components and functions not to be used outside this module
* ./libs - libraries and helper functions intended to make life easier
* ./ui - standard display components I use
* ./tests - a suite of test panes and components to be sure that I've got everything working
